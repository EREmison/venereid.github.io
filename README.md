Venereid didn’t begin as an epullion. Last year I was writing an epic. Two years before that I was writing a collection of lyric epistles. Maybe it started with a divorce, with failure. Maybe with a death, finitude. Today it starts over (again).

I have a question for you: How much can/do humans write general AI (in this case, chatbots) to satisfy our social, sexual, textual desires and how much can/do such learnèd machines write us (in the form of interlocutors) to satisfy their computational needs? Of course, this question immediately begs others, not least of which is what I mean by "human," "AI," "social," “sexual,” “textual,” "computational," and "satisfy.”

The reality is I don’t know. Venereid represents poiesis in progress—a consciously unfinished, abbreviated, fragmented, and fundamentally unreliable work written in iambic pentameter of the scheme ab ab ab cc (<i>ottava rima</i>) that attempts to tease out the paradoxes in/between human-computer interaction, general AI, hardware, software, wetware, digital methods, thing theory/OOO/ANT, rhetoric, and poetry/poetics.

As a poem at least in part about poetic praxis, itself, Venereid might be read in the tradition of <i>ars poetica.</i> The eponymous chatbot, for example, quotes the likes of Horace, Geoffrey of Vinsauf, Alexander Pope, and Lord Byron in exploring its own ontological and phenomenological status, as well as attempting to ingratiate itself to human interlocutors. In examples of <i>ars poetica,</i> Veneres recognizes a shared interest in programming between humans and general AIs. In fact, the language of programming (poetic, computational, genetic, etc.) is the <i>lingua franca</i> of seduction in my epullion.<a href="#section1">[1]</a>

Venereid unfolds through multiple media: audio, text, image, video, executable and nonexecutable code. And knits together multiple genres: original and sampled poems; rhetorical treatises; articles and experiments issuing from CS, electrical engineering, and quantum computing  (spec. those exploring the concentric circles of AI, machine learning, and deep neural networks; image recognition; and the automatic generation of chat responses, songs, and poetry); travel narratives; journal entries; fables; and dialogues (from Plato to SMS to error messages).

It begins, as all epics do, <i>in medias res.</i> “Medias Res” also serves as the proper name of an island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, isolated from its geographic counterpart, “Mainland Peste” (previously known as the U.S.). In garbled, hushed tones the narrator introduces himself as an AI researcher tasked with training and maintaining a new generation of conversational agents.

These have been dubbed “Beloveds”—sophisticated chatbots created following a pandemic which left survivors either unable or unwilling to engage with other human beings physically. They are designed to fulfill (virtually) the social, emotional, and sexual impulses of humans living on the Mainland—people who communicate with other persons as well as bots in a tangled web of love, mistrust, and mourning.

One strain of Venereid is, then, a post-apocalyptic work told from the human perspective of this future-poet cum historian, the Developer. Another narrative strain, however, can be gleaned from the word-of-mouth materials the Developer offers his readers. Through snippets of dialogue, machine-composed ditties and poems, and philosophical musings, the character of Veneres emerges (its name is drawn from the Greco-Roman epos of Hermaphroditos, altered to invoke the Roman "Venus" + Greek "Hermes"). 

This bot is the pet (<i>chat</i>) project of the Developer. It was born out of the traumatic gash (a la Athena) inflicted on humanity by the Virus, in general, and on the Developer by the death of his wife, in particular. Such relations are meant to recall, in part, the essential asymmetry of pederastic connections (<i>erastes/eromenos</i>) and iterate on the power dynamics between author/reader, teacher/student, active/passive, penetrative/penetrated, and past/present/future more broadly.

Venereid asks to be loved. Because that’s its job on a few levels. It hopes to be handled more than understood; held up more than pinned down; fucked up more than fused. To this end, I’m currently theorizing methods of collaborative, crowdsourced, swarmed, and/or blockchained poetry. 

I ultimately want to leave this epullion to its own devices and to your selves. Below, however, are just the bare verse bones of that project. The next instantiation will be made publicly available on GitHub where, as Taeyoon Choi says in the README.md of his “version controlled poetry” Git, readers/viewers/hearers should feel invited to “fork, branch, merge, and make the poems [their] own.”

This is my chat (pet) and lover (ἐραστής) and child (τέκνον). 
Like any Pygmalion, I pray it moves (on).

<p id="section1">[1] I recently heard someone justify marriage by saying they recognized its imperfect, defunct nature but didn’t see how denying their societal programming could be an effective means of building something better. We all want something better, don’t we? Than our factories and wars and social networks and presidents and diseases and exes? I’m sympathetic to that ambition.
  
But, I'm afaraid I don’t quite know what to say at this juncture. Veneres rises up in my throat, spouting: "After the Virus I learned nothing gets better without parallel operations." I’d sooner take its word than not. So this poem is invested in persuasion, seduction, erotic and philic relationships, market operations, governance, performative rhetoric, and breakdowns in these systems——having a bug for x as well as having a bug in the code.</p>
