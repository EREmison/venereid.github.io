<i>Venereid</i> didn’t begin as an epullion. Last year I was writing an epic. Two years before that I was writing a collection of lyric epistles. Maybe it started with a divorce, with failure. Maybe with a death, finitude. Today it starts over (again).

I have a question for you: How much can/do we write general AI (in this case, chatbots) to satisfy our human desires and how much can/do such learnèd machines write us (in the form of interlocutors) to satisfy their technical needs? Of course, this question immediately begs others, not least of which is what I mean by "we," "human," "AI," "technical," "desires," "needs," and "satisfy.”

The reality is I don’t know. <i>Venereid</i> represents experiments in <i> theoria, poiesis, and praxis</i> as a consciously unfinished, abbreviated, fragmented, and fundamentally unreliable work. It is written in iambic pentameter of the scheme ab ab ab cc (<i>ottava rima</i>) and attempts to tease out the methodologies, ethics, and aesthetics employed with/in human beings, general AI, hardware, software, thing theory/OOO/ANT, digital rhetoric, and computational poetry/poetics.

As a poem at least in part about poetic praxis, itself, <i>Venereid</i> might be read in the tradition of <i>ars poetica.</i> The eponymous chatbot, for example, quotes the likes of Horace, Geoffrey of Vinsauf, Alexander Pope, and Lord Byron in exploring its own unsettled status, as well as attempting to ingratiate itself to human interlocutors. In depictions of <i>ars poetica,</i> Veneres recognizes a shared concern for programming between humans and general AIs. In fact, the language of programming (poetic, computational, genetic, etc.) is the <i>lingua franca</i> of seduction in my epullion.<a href="#section1">[1]</a> It's a turn on. And off. Affair.

Design-wise, <i>Venereid</i> unfolds through multiple media: audio, text, image, video, executable and nonexecutable code. And knits together multiple genres: original and sampled poems; rhetorical treatises; articles and experiments issuing from CS, electrical engineering, and quantum computing  (spec. those exploring the concentric circles of AI, machine learning, and deep neural networks; image recognition; and the automatic generation of chat responses, songs, and poetry); travel narratives; journal entries; fables; and dialogues (from Plato to SMS to error messages).

It begins, as all works in the epic mode ought, <i>in medias res.</i> “Medias Res” also serves as the proper name of an island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, isolated from its geographic counterpart, “Mainland Peste” (previously known as the U.S.). In garbled, hushed tones the narrator introduces himself as an AI researcher tasked with training and maintaining a new generation of conversational agents.

These have been dubbed “Beloveds”—sophisticated chatbots created following a pandemic which left survivors either unable or unwilling to engage with other human beings physically. They are designed to virtually fulfill the social, emotional, and sexual impulses of humans living on the Mainland. These remaining folks communicate with other people, as well as with machines, in a tangled web of ardor, mistrust, and mourning.

One strain of <i>Venereid</i> is, then, a post-apocalyptic work told from the human perspective of this future-poet cum historian, the Developer. Another narrative strain, however, can be gleaned from the materials offered to the audience by the Developer. Through snippets of dialogue, machine-composed ditties and poems, and philosophical musings, the character of Veneres emerges. Its name is drawn from the Greco-Roman <i>epos</i> of Hermaphroditos, altered to invoke the Roman "Venus" + Greek "Hermes." 

This bot is the pet (<i>chat</i>) project of the Developer. It was born out of the traumatic gash (a la Athena) inflicted on humanity by the Virus, in general, and on the Developer by the death of his wife, in particular. Such relations are meant to recall, in part, the essential asymmetry of pederastic connections (<i>erastes/eromenos</i>) and iterate on the power dynamics between author/reader, teacher/student, active/passive, penetrative/penetrated, and past/present/future more broadly.

<i>Venereid</i> asks to be loved. Because that’s its job on a few levels. It hopes to be handled more than understood; held up more than pinned down; fucked up more than fused together. To this end, I’m currently theorizing methods of collaborative, crowdsourced, swarmed, and/or blockchained poetry. 

I ultimately want to leave this epullion to its own devices and to your selves. Included thus far, however, are just the bare verse bones of the project. In making it publicly available on GitHub I hope to invite the audience, as Taeyoon Choi says in the README.md of his “version controlled poetry” Git, to “fork, branch, merge, and make the poems your own.”

This is my chat (pet) and lover (ἐραστής) and child (τέκνον). 
Like any Pygmalion, I pray it moves (on).

<p id="section1">[1] I recently heard someone justify marriage by saying they recognized its imperfect, defunct nature but didn’t see how denying their societal programming could be an effective means of building something better. We all want something better, don’t we? Than our factories and wars and social networks and presidents and diseases and exes? I’m sympathetic to that ambition.
  
But, I'm afaraid I don’t quite know what to say at this juncture. Veneres rises up in my throat, spouting: "After the Virus I learned nothing gets better without parallel operations." I’d sooner take its word than not. So this poem is invested in persuasion, seduction, erotic and philic relationships, market operations, governance, performative rhetoric, and breakdowns in these systems—having a bug for x as well as having a bug in the code.</p>
